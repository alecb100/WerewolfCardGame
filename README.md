# Cards Created

- <b><u>Villager</u></b> - The plain Villager is the default card in the Werewolf game. Usually this card outnumbers all other cards. Every day, the villagers wake up and try to find out which one of their neighbors are werewolves. At the end of every day, they choose one person to kill. There are many other cards that are on the villager team, including the Seer, Hunter, etc. They win once they have killed all of the werewolves. There can still be people alive that are on the werewolf team (like the minion), but the actual werewolves must be dead. These include the plain Werewolf, the Wolf Man, the Dire Wolf, and the Werewolf Cub.
- <b><u>Werewolf</u></b> - This is the plain Werewolf, the main werewolf of the game. They wake up every night and choose one person to kill (doing that every night). They win by eliminating enough villagers so that the amount of alive werewolves or their sympathizers equal or is greater than the amount of alive villagers. There are other werewolves in the game, including the Dire Wolf, the Wolf Man, and the Werewolf Cub. They also have helpers, such as the minion, who do not actually count as werewolves but are on the werewolves team.
- <b><u>Tanner</u></b> - The Tanner card is the card that wishes to die. They win instantly if they are killed by any means. They may use any means necessary to get someone to kill them. Either make people think they're a werewolf, become unreliable so it seems they are a werewolf, etc. As long as they die, they win.
- <b><u>Troublemaker</u></b> - The Troublemaker is just that, a troublemaker. They are on the villager team and is woken up to decide if they want to use their ability or not. They can only use their ability once in the entire game. Their ability is to force the villagers to kill 2 people rather than 1 the following day.  They never have to use their ability in the game, but if they do choose to, they can't use it again.
- <b><u>Seer</u></b> - The seer is one of the most important villagers in the game. They have the ability to see if a player is a type of werewolf. Every night, they are asked who they want to check and are told if they are a type of werewolf or not. The werewolf types are Werewolf, Dire Wolf, Wolf Cub, and Wolf Man. However, there is a villager card that they see as a werewolf called the Lycan. Everything else counts as a villager.
- <b><u>Bodyguard</u></b> - The Bodyguard chooses one person to protect from being killed every night. They can protect a different person every night and can also choose themselves. The only thing they cannot protect a person from is dying because a person they are linked with dies, like people who were chosen by the Cupid. They are on the villagers team and count as a villager.
- <b><u>Cupid</u></b> - The Cupid card is one of the cooler cards, but is confusing to understand. The cupid wakes up the first night and chooses 2 people to link together (they can choose themselves if they want). Once one of them dies, the other also dies, and cannot be prevented. They both know who they are linked to, but they don't know what their card is. Depending on their card, they may have switched to a different team. If they were both on the same team, they remain on that team. If one was a villager and the other was on the werewolf team but NOT a werewolf (like a minion), they are both on the villager team. In any other circumstance, they are on their own team and can only win if they are the last people alive. It is more than likely that these 2 are on the villager team as there are always more villagers than other cards, so it's in the cupid's best interest not to say who they linked (because they are always on the villager team, unless they chose to link themselves) as the werewolves would go after them if they both weren't werewolves. However, they may not be on the villager team, so it is ultimately up to the Cupid to reveal them or not.
  - Here are the conditions for team switching:
  1. If both were on the same team, they remain on the same team.
  2. If one was a villager and the other on the werewolf team but NOT a werewolf, they are both on the villager team.
  3. In any other circumstance, they are on their own team and will only win if they are the only ones to remain.
  - The cupid is not affected by the linked people, but this overrides all other win conditions.
- <b><u>Minion</u></b> - The Minion is on the werewolf team. Their only special trait is that they know who all of the werewolves are, but they don't know who he is. His whole goal is to take suspicion away from the werewolves so that his team can win. That may include pulling suspicion over to himself.
